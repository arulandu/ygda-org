NATUREDASH is a magical rhythm game where you use the powers of a tiny nature spirit to smack, beat, and time hits against your own eco-anxiety! There are six exciting songs to uncover, each one progressing you towards overcoming your fear and taking action instead. You'll also learn about the beauty of nature in your lush hometown - and how important it is to nurture it.
