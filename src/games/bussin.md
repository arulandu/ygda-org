One of [YGDA](https://ygda.org)'s first games, Bussin' features an enthusiastic
bus driver, racing around a low-poly town picking up and dropping off kids as
fast as possible. I led a team of four, primarily working on procedural world
generation with wave function collapse. All music, sprites, and code were
produced in-house.
